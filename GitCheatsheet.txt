Git(Hub) (and Vim) notes

Vim - Press i to start writing text, and :wq to save and quit (:q would just quit)

Git:

How to make a repo:

1) git init in the folder where you want the repo to be
2) git add $FILENAME for each file you want in the repo or git add -all to add all files

How to commit changes:

git commit -m "message" saves a version of what you're working on.
Make sure to leave a message with -m every time to make sure you don't forget what changed.

Git branches:

A branch is an alternate version of a repo that braches from the base repo.
These are used to make changes without disturbing the main project.

To creat a branch you use git branch $BRANCH_NAME and git checkout $BRANCH_NAME to switch between branches.
Note that the base version of your repo is the master branch (git checkout master).

Merging Branches:

Once you are ready to merge two branches together (a side branch and the master branch, for example) you

1) Switch to the branch you want to keep (like the master branch)
2) Use git merge $SECOND_BRANCH_NAME to merge the two branches together (there can be issues with this)
3) Use git branch -d $SECOND_BRANCH_NAME to delete the branch that was merged if you don't need it anymore.

The issues with merge arise if both changed the same file. To fix this, you edit the file on the branch you 
want to be merged and then commit those changes.
