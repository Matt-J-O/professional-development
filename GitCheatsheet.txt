Git(Hub) (and Vim) notes

Vim - Press i to start writing text, and :wq to save and quit (:q would just quit)

Git:

How to make a repo:

1) git init in the folder where you want the repo to be
2) git add $FILENAME for each file you want in the repo or git add -all to add all files

How to commit changes:

git commit -m "message" saves a version of what you're working on.
Make sure to leave a message with -m every time to make sure you don't forget what changed.

Git branches:

A branch is an alternate version of a repo that braches from the base repo.
These are used to make changes without disturbing the main project.

To creat a branch you use git branch $BRANCH_NAME and git checkout $BRANCH_NAME to switch between branches.
